# Realm-Rush-Udemy
Repo for my follow through of the Realm Rush segment in the Unity 3D course on Udemy. Repo created after first build of project, so it won't show complete history of progress.

Only includes the first half of the lesson (no path finding), and has some additions that I made to the project myself. These additions are:
- Scriptable objects to track stats (enemy, tower, waves)
- A 'modular' wave system, allowing for easy customization for multiple waves
- A range mesh that can be visualized by clicking on the towers
- Multiple enemy types
- A new tower type

I may continue to work on this and add more towers/enemys to it, but I believe I have the feature set complete that I wanted to accomplish for this lesson. Feel free to snag anything you'd like
or fork the repo for your own use. Was pretty happy with what is now my second unity build, and just wanted to put it out into the world in one way or another.
